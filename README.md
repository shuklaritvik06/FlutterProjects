# Learning Flutter

Flutter is an open-source UI software development kit created by Google. It is used to develop cross platform applications for Android, iOS, Linux, Mac, Windows, Google Fuchsia, Web platform, and the web from a single codebase

Flutter enables you to make instant changes in the app which is a god-sent when it comes to fixing bugs. Flutter-based apps are very smooth in their performance which makes for great UX. With a single code base, quality assurance and testing usually takes much less time.

This repository contains all the projects which I made while Learning **Flutter Development** during my **Six Months** Hustling Journey. This will help me in upskilling myself and learn more about the technology.
